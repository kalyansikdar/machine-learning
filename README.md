This projects are part of the Machine Learning course taken in the University of Texas at Arlington under Dr. Chris Ding. The main tasks are as follows:

1. Write your own KNN, Centroid, Cross Vaidation functions.
2. Implement your own K-means algorithm and improve accuracy using maximum bi-partite graph(Munkre's Algorithm)
3. Write your function to calculate F-test scores of the features.

Requirement specifications and detailed implementation of each of the tasks can be found inside the folders.
